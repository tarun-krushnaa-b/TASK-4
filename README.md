#Task 4

Exploring Customer Trends with Power BI

Objective:

Build a Power BI dashboard to analyze customer behavior and trends based on sales data. Focus on creating meaningful visuals, applying drill-through functionality, and identifying patterns.

Dataset Overview:

You will use a dataset containing the following columns:
Customer ID
Customer Name
Age Group
Gender
Region
Product Category
Sales Amount
Profit
Purchase Date

Instructions:

Data Import and Preparation
Load the dataset into Power BI.
Create a calculated column for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using the formula:CLV=Sales Amount×5\text{CLV} = \text{Sales Amount} \times 5CLV=Sales Amount×5
Ensure all columns have appropriate data types and formats.

Visualizations

Build the following visuals:
A bar chart showing total Sales Amount by Age Group.
A stacked column chart showing Sales Amount by Gender and split by Product Category.
A map visual showing Sales Amount by Region.
A scatter chart showing Profit vs. Sales Amount for each customer, sized by CLV.

Drill-Through Functionality

Create a drill-through page to analyze individual customers.
Include a table with the customer's details (Customer Name, Region, Product Category, Sales Amount, Profit, and CLV).
Ensure users can right-click on any visual to access the drill-through page.

Filters and Slicers

Add slicers for Region and Gender.
Add a date range slicer for Purchase Date.
Formatting and Customization
Use a consistent theme for your visuals.
Add a title: "Customer Trends and Insights Dashboard."
Use tooltips to show additional information like CLV when hovering over visuals.

Insights

Add a text box summarizing at least 3 key insights from your analysis (e.g., which age group spends the most, regional trends, or high-value customers).
